# Lighweight ECS Framework
My pet project. Performance, zero/small memory allocations/footprint, no/minimal code generation, no dependencies on any game engine, built-in networking actions(ecs state serialization) with rollbacks and lockstep - main goals of this project.

This ECS framework will be finalized over time.
